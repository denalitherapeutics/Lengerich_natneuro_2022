```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r, include = FALSE}
libraries <-
  c("aws.s3",
    "dplyr",
    "ggplot2",
    "here",
    "Matrix",
    "plyr",
    "Seurat"
)
lapply(libraries, library, character.only = TRUE)


meta <- read.csv(here("inst", "extdata", "Study1_sample_metadata.csv"))

meta$sample_id <- meta$parent_id
meta$sample_id <- plyr::mapvalues(
  meta$sample_id,
  from = c("NH1G", "NH2G", "NH3G", "NH4G", "NH5G"),

```

Now we can read in the data. This tutorial assumes we are working with 10x data. But it's easy enough to adapt this to other library types.

## reading in data
```{r}

samples <- c(meta$sample_id)

# Read in counts matrix from each pool of libraries and build a Seurat object
# we'll also add the sample-level data to each object.


# FIXME: does this function read from a local directory? 
objects <- lapply(
  samples,
  FUN = function(x) {
    object <- Seurat::Read10X(
      
      # FIXME: use the file.path function instead of paste0 because different
      # operating systems use different path delimiters (\ or /).
      file.path(
        "Study1", "cellranger_7.0.0", x, "outs", "filtered_feature_bc_matrix"
      ),
      project = "atv_trem2_timecourse"
    ) 
    
    object[["sample_id"]] <- x #adding sample ID
    
    sample_meta <-
      meta %>% 
      dplyr::filter(meta, sample_id == x) #subsetting the meta data
    
    object@meta.data <-
      object@meta.data %>% 
      dplyr::left_join(meta, by = "sample_id") #adding sample-level metadata
    
    rownames(object@meta.data) <-
      colnames(object) #resetting rownames, because they get dropped
    
    # FIXME: I like to use explicit return statements, but that's optional :-)
    return(object)
  }
)

```

```{r}
# Now we'll combine objects each object according to their batch ID. 
# Just combine all objects from each batch.

# FIXME: merging objects by index can be dangerous. Is there a way to make sure
# the objects at each position in `objects` are actually what they are expected
# to be?
batch4_merged <- merge(objects[[1]], c(objects[[2]],
                                       objects[[3]],
                                       objects[[4]],
                                       objects[[5]],

                                        objects[[14]],
                                        objects[[15]],
                                        objects[[16]]))
